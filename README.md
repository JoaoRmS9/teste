# [WIP] Distributed Systems Class Projects

Welcome to the GitHub **monorepo** for the Distributed Systems class! This repository is a collection of practical examples and projects related to distributed computing. Each project within this monorepo is designed to help students understand the principles and challenges of designing, implementing, and managing distributed systems.

## About This Repository

This monorepo is curated as part of the educational curriculum for students studying Distributed Systems. The projects included herein cover a wide range of topics within distributed computing, such as consensus algorithms, distributed databases, microservices architecture, fault tolerance, scalability, and more.

### Objectives

- To provide hands-on experience with various distributed system designs and patterns.
- To encourage experimentation with different technologies and frameworks in a distributed context.
- To enhance understanding of the complexities and trade-offs in building distributed systems.

## Projects Overview

Each project in this monorepo is contained in its own directory, along with a specific README file that details the project's goals, the technologies used, setup instructions, and any other relevant information. You will see that some of the README files are in Portuguese (Brazil).

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, you will need to have a basic understanding of distributed systems, as well as some familiarity with programming languages and development tools used throughout the projects. Each project's README will guide you through the necessary steps to build and run the examples.

### Prerequisites

- General knowledge of distributed systems concepts.
- Familiarity with programming languages such as Python.
- Basic understanding of containerization and orchestration tools like Docker and Kubernetes may be required for some projects.
